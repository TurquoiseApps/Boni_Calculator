This is a C-14 Dating calculator. Just enter the percentage of C-14 and get the age of the bone.

## Full Description
The formula for radioactive decay is important in radiocarbon dating, which is used to calculate the approximate date a plant or animal died. Radiocarbon dating was discovered in 1949 by Willard Libby, who won a Nobel Prize for his discovery.

Boni Calc helps Biology students calculate the age of a bone/plant using Radiocarbon Dating. It is based on the formula for radioactive decay: 
t= ln(r)/-0.000121

You just enter the percentage of Carbon-14 that the bone/plant contains and press the AGE button.
